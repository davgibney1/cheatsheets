# cheatsheets

Cheatsheets for git, bash, linux, aws, python, powershell...

Some of these sheets may be cryptic, especially ones I have made and used over the years.  Others will be more intuitive, since some of these documents are copies of third-party published cheatsheets.  If I can cite sources on them, I will.

This repo is really meant for me, anyway, so I can have easy, central access to the good technical references I've come across..  Feel free to submit a pull request if you would like to contribute.
